The eyelid area was the key. Nearly 21 percent missed this area with moisturizer compared to 14 percent with sunscreen.“We haven’t been able to find out exac why our participants overed less facial area with moisturizer than sunscreen,” McCormick, who is also an honorary lecturer at University of Liverpool, told Healthline. “It is possible that subconsciously people are not as thorough as when they are applying a product to specifically protect the skin, but this is speculation.” He added, “It could also be due to the nature and properties of the cream. A more spreadable cream is likely to reach more area and sunscreen may behave in this way.” Dr. Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic, told Healthline that facial moisturizers with SPF do tend to be “thinner and more watery.” She said that they spread easily, which can lead to a thinner layer being applied on your face. Piliang said there are other theories about the disparity between the application of sunscreen versus moisturizer.
